# Cylindrical-cavity-resonator-for-food-moisture-measurment

# Description
This repository includes the data measured using a cylindrical cavity resonator in order to calculate moisture content of raw peanuts. The project took place in the context of "Non Destructive Evaluation Techniques" Subject.

# Experiment Procedure

The experiment procedure is the following:

* Peanuts were placed for 24 hours in water untill they abosrbed the maximum possible amount of water.
* Wet Peanuts were placed in the oven. 150 Celsius degrees.
* While they were in the oven, samples were taken and their weight was measured.
* Average moisture of each group of samples was calculated based on the driest samples weight.
* Using a Network Analyzer and placing samples inside cavity resonator, conclusions were extracted.

# Important Results and Conclusions

*The dryer the peanut, the higher the resonance frequency*
